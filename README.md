sorry i hate Visual Studio it just doesn't work as well as pycharm!

p1: randomaly generates a color palette of 4 colors and my sister says if it looks good, there are 2 arrays for the good and bad palettes.

p2: there weren't as much good as bad so i downloaded some more.

p3: every 4 colors can be arranged in 24 diffrent ways so i did that to make my data bigger.

p4: i'll scramble the arrays so when i take the last 50 to the test array there wouldn't be 24 diffrent wasys that show the same palette.

p5: just making the Y arrays for the X arrays

main: with the data and a neuron system i am doing machine learning.

system: actully doing something with the machine i made, you pick 3 colors and the machine will give you a tonnnnnnnnn of colors that will go well with your 3.

run system for the full experience

run main just for the machine learning part
